  <h1>Wesley Rojas - CS448 Final Project - MLB Hitter and Pitcher Analysis Using Statcast Data</h1>
  <p>Over the past several years, the use of sophisticated tracking technology has revolutionized the way we analyze and
    understand the game of baseball. One such technology, Statcast, has allowed us to go beyond traditional metrics and
    gain deeper insights into player performance. In this project, we will explore Statcast data to analyze MLB hitters
    and pitchers using several key data points.
  </p>
  <p>
    Statcast is a high-speed, high-accuracy tracking system that collects data on a wide range of baseball plays. For
    this analysis, we have chosen to focus on the following columns: Pitcher, Batter, pitch_type, zone (region
    within/out of the strike zone), xwOBA, Month, and Year. These columns allow us to create visualizations of all the
    pitches a batter saw or a pitcher threw during a given period.
  </p>
  <p>
    By examining the xwOBA (expected weighted on-base average) statistic, we can approximate a player's success on
    pitches
    in a specific zone. For some brief background, the wOBA (weighted On-Base Average) statistic gives us an idea of a
    player's offensive contributions by considering how they reached base, appropriately giving a home run greater
    weight than a single. “xwOBA” (expected wOBA) is a further refinement of this concept, using Statcast data to
    determine a
    player's expected wOBA based on the exit speed and launch angle of every ball that a player hits. wOBA measures
    actual offensive outcomes, while xwOBA estimates deserved outcomes based on the quality of contact.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the Statcast data sets have a pre-populated column displaying the xwOBA values for each ball that has been
    hit every season since 2017, we have chosen to use this highly objective measure to represent batter and pitcher
    performance. A batter will always want a higher xwOBA, while pitchers will always try to minimize the xwOBA on
    pitches they throw. In addition to xwOBA, each zone will display the relative proportion of pitches from the current
    subset of pitches that were thrown in each respective zone. Each of the following visualizations are depictions of
    the strike
    zone and surrounding out-of-the-strike-zone regions from the catcher's perspective, from behind home plate.
  </p>
  <p>
    When viewing the batters' names, you might notice (R), (L), or (S) next to their names. These letters indicate which
    side of the plate the batter stands on. (R) stands for right-handed batters, who stand on the left side of the plate
    from the catcher's perspective. (L) indicates left-handed batters, who stand on the right side of the plate, and (S)
    represents switch-hitters, who can bat from either side of the plate depending on the handedness of the pitcher.
  </p>
  In these visualizations, you'll encounter different pitch types, including:
  <p>
    Four Seam Fastball (FF): A fast pitch with minimal horizontal movement and slight upward movement;
    Two Seam Fastball (FT): A fast pitch with more horizontal movement than the four-seam fastball and slightly less
    speed;
    Slider (SL): A breaking pitch that moves laterally and has a downward break;
    Changeup (CH): A slower pitch that looks like a fastball but has less velocity and more downward movement;
    Curveball (CU): A breaking pitch with significant downward movement and less horizontal movement than a slider;
    Cutter (FC): A pitch with characteristics between a fastball and a slider, having both some speed and lateral
    movement
    Our first visualization also allows you to filter batters' results by the pitcher's throwing arm (L or R). In
    baseball, platoon splits typically mean right-handed hitters struggle more against right-handed pitchers and vice
    versa for left-handed hitters. For switch-hitters, they will choose their batting side based on the pitcher's
    handedness, standing on the opposite side of the plate from the pitcher's throwing arm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our first visualization focuses on pitch distribution and expected results for batters. This interactive tool allows
    you to explore how various factors, such as year, month, zone, pitch type, and pitcher's throwing arm can affect a
    batter's performance. This visualization can help us gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of
    individual batters and how they perform against specific pitch types and pitchers.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this visual, the strike zone is colored to be darker green in zones where the hitter is having greater success,
    and redder in zones where the hitter is having difficulty producing quality contact. The regions outside of the
    strike zone are colored darker blue in zones where a higher proportion of pitches were thrown. This gives us an
    idea of where a pitcher is targeting his attacks, as professional pitchers typicallly aim their pitches near the
    edge
    of the strike zone.

    Please be paitent as the first and
    second visuals can take a while to load.

      Our second visualization focuses on pitch distribution and expected results for pitchers. This interactive tool
      allows you to explore how various factors, such as year, month, zone, pitch type, and batter's hitting stance can
      affect a pitcher's performance. This visualization can help us gain a deeper understanding of the tendencies of
      pitchers
      in certain scenarios, potentially allowing batters to identify a general zone and pitch where the pitcher is
      vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this visual, the strike zone is colored to be darker green in zones where the pitcher is having greater success
      and redder in zones where the pitcher is having difficulty preventing quality contact. The regions outside of the
      strike zone (balls) are colored darker red in zones where a higher proportion of pitches were thrown. This gives
      us an
      idea of where a pitcher is targeting their attacks.

      Our third visualization focuses on pitch distribution and expected results for specific pitcher-batter matchups.
      This interactive tool allows you to explore some interesting matchups between the pitchers and hitters who saw
      one another the most in each given season. This visualization can help us see in season adptations by pitchers 
      and hitters against one another during the course of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this visual, the strike zone is colored to be darker red in zones where the pitcher is having greater success
      and darker blue in zones where the batter is producing quality contact against the pitcher. The regions outside of the
      strike zone are not dynamically colored in any way.

      This project provides a tool to support the analysis of numerous aspects of baseball pitcher vs hitter dynamics.
      For some examples of the applications of this visualization that might benefit a hitter or pitcher, see my
      submission video.
